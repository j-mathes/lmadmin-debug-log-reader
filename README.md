# lmadmin_feature_usage_summary.py

📊 **FlexNet License Feature Usage Summary Tool**

This Python script parses FlexNet `lmadmin` debug logs to generate a summary of feature usage over time. It’s designed to help license administrators and engineers understand how licensed features are being utilized across their network.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Extracts license checkouts (`OUT`) and check-ins (`IN`) from `lmadmin` debug logs
- Aggregates usage data by feature and timestamp
- Outputs a CSV summary showing:
  - Feature name
  - Number of licenses checked out
  - Number of licenses returned
  - Timestamps of activity

---

## 📁 Input

- **Debug Log File**: A plain text log file generated by `lmadmin`, typically located in:
  ```
  C:\ProgramData\FLEXlm\lmadmin\logs\debug.log
  ```

---

## 📤 Output

- **Text File**: The script generates a summary file named using the current timestamp. For example:
  ```
  2025-07-22_10-45-03_feature_report.txt
  ```
- The file includes detailed usage data, structured like:
```
