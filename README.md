# lmadmin_feature_usage_summary.py

📊 **FlexNet License Feature Usage Summary Tool**

This Python script parses FlexNet `lmadmin` debug logs to generate a summary of feature usage over time. It’s designed to help license administrators and engineers understand how licensed features are being utilized across their network.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Extracts license checkouts (`OUT`) and check-ins (`IN`) from `lmadmin` debug logs
- Aggregates usage data by feature and timestamp
- Outputs a CSV summary showing:
  - Feature name
  - Number of licenses checked out
  - Number of licenses returned
  - Timestamps of activity

---

## 📁 Input

- **Debug Log File**: A plain text log file generated by `lmadmin`, typically located in:
  ```
  C:\ProgramData\FLEXlm\lmadmin\logs\debug.log
  ```

---

## 📤 Output

- **CSV File**: A summary file named `feature_usage_summary.csv` containing:
  ```
  Feature, Checked Out, Returned, First Seen, Last Seen
  ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python lmadmin_feature_usage_summary.py path/to/debug.log
```

Replace `path/to/debug.log` with the actual path to your FlexNet debug log file.

---

## 🐍 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies (uses built-in libraries)

---

## 📌 Notes

- The script assumes standard FlexNet log formatting with `OUT:` and `IN:` entries.
- It does not currently support logs from `lmgrd` or other license managers.
